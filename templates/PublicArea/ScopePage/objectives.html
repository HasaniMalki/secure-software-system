                                            1. Find the best donors using an algorithm. The best donors are selected according to the donor’s blood group, donor’s age, donor’s donation penalty date, donor’s availability and the distance between the donor and the hospital.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> 
                                            2. Create three difference covering areas from the blood donation centre. Three different stages were created to separate three difference covering areas. In stage 1 it covers 2 km around the hospital, in stage 2 it covers 5 km around the hospital and in stage 3 it covers 10 km around the hospital.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> 
                                            3. Select needed donors’ count and get their distances. The user can enter the count of donors to the system and get their distances. The result will be changed according to the inputs.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> 
                                            4. Inform donors using automatically message system. After selecting the best donors. A message is sent automatically to the relevant donors and get their response using a form.
                                        </p>
